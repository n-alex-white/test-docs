# Profile

> This is a demo document, with pretend information

The customer profile is created upon registration. The customer is able to update certain fields when they have authenticated in their personal account, but other fields are internal to our operational use of the customer profile and are either not visible or visible but not editable. 

The system distinguishes between regular customers and test customers because we support testing in production for all our systems. Test customers have -ve customer ids, which is how we are able to distinguish them throughout our estate.
